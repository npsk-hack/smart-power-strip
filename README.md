# Jeeves and Wooster
#### NPSI Mysore
- In essence, it's a power strip that has a little more brains. We have four individually controllable sockets, where you can turn each on or off. Jeeves is the power strip.
- Smart homes are based on the concept of IoT, or Internet of Things. So, this power strip of ours can be connected to the internet with built-in WiFi.
- Our plan for this is to create an app that allows you to control your four sockets in an elegant and functional way. Wooster is the app.
- This power strip, in the future, can be easily and cheaply replicated with locally available parts.
- The scope for smart home products like ours is huge. They greatly convenience our daily lives, and are especially useful to those who are specially abled.
- Another aspect to be considered is that with this, people can turn things off when not needed from their phone, thus conserving energy, both of the user and city power.
- Our product/idea is special because this is completely homebrew, taking advantage of local resources. It is designed for the average Indian middle class household, which would ordinarily not have the means for easy procurement or use.
- The app will be optimized for easy use by the average person.
